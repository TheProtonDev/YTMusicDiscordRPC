### This is just a simple little script primarily targeted towards Arch Linux users to fetch the currently playing song and set it as a Discord Rich Presence Status

## Running It:
### Install `PyPresence` using pip
```bash
pip install pypresence
```

## You can then test and run the script using
### Make sure you have audio playing from YouTube Music and have `playerctl` installed (if you don't simply run): ``sudo pacman -S playerctl``
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### PS: I recomend checking out the ``example_usage.sh`` file as it may contain helpful inspiration to making a launcher script for YouTube Music in whatever browser you use and this script
